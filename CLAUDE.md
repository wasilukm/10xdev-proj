# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: EnvBooker

Django 6.0.5 web app on **Python 3.14** (see `.python-version`), managed with **uv** (not pip/poetry). Single Django config package at `envbooker/`; no domain apps yet — they'll be added as the PRD ships. SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) for dev; **Railway** is the deploy target (see `railway.toml` and `context/foundation/infrastructure.md`). Product & stack rationale live in `context/foundation/`.

### Common commands

```bash
uv sync                              # install/refresh dependencies from uv.lock
uv add <pkg>                         # add a runtime dependency
uv run python manage.py runserver    # dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run python manage.py migrate      # apply pending migrations
uv run python manage.py makemigrations <app>  # generate migrations after model changes
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser       # bootstrap an admin user
uv run python manage.py test                  # run the full Django test suite
uv run python manage.py test <app>            # run tests for a single app
```

### Local dev setup

Local dev uses **Postgres** (not SQLite) for full parity with Railway prod (exclusion constraints require it). Start Postgres first:

```bash
docker compose up -d              # start Postgres 17 on localhost:5432
```

Then export the three required env vars (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=any-local-secret-value
export DJANGO_DEBUG=True          # optional; defaults to False if unset
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://envbooker:envbooker@localhost:5432/envbooker
```

Run migrations and start the dev server:

```bash
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

### Project-specific tripwires

- **The uv-managed `.venv` has no `pip`**, so `pip-audit` cannot use `PIPAPI_PYTHON_LOCATION`. Audit via:
  `uv export --no-hashes | grep -v '^#' | pip-audit -r /dev/stdin`
- **Railway deploy** is defined in `railway.toml`: Railpack builder (auto-detects `uv.lock` + `.python-version`), runs `collectstatic → migrate → gunicorn` on start. No Dockerfile needed.
- **No linting tools** are configured in `pyproject.toml` yet — add ruff or similar before wiring up CI.

## Course context

This is a **10xDevs 3.0** course project (`10xdevs3`), configured for Claude Code via `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli` (v1.6.0). Lesson artifacts (prompts, skills, rules, configs) are fetched from the course platform and written into `.claude/`.

## Fetching lesson content

```bash
10x list                          # browse available modules and lessons
10x get <ref>                     # fetch a lesson (e.g. m1l1 = Module 1 Lesson 1)
10x get <ref> --tool claude-code  # explicit tool override
10x get <ref> --dry-run           # preview what would be written
10x doctor                        # validate auth and connectivity
```

Artifacts land in `.claude/prompts/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc. The manifest tracking applied lessons is at `.claude/.10x-cli-manifest.json`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
