# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: EnvBooker

Django 6.0.5 web app on **Python 3.14** (see `.python-version`), managed with **uv** (not pip/poetry). Single Django config package at `envbooker/`; no domain apps yet — they'll be added as the PRD ships. SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) for dev; **Railway** is the deploy target (see `railway.toml` and `context/foundation/infrastructure.md`). Product & stack rationale live in `context/foundation/`.

### Common commands

```bash
uv sync                              # install/refresh dependencies from uv.lock
uv add <pkg>                         # add a runtime dependency
uv run python manage.py runserver    # dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run python manage.py migrate      # apply pending migrations
uv run python manage.py makemigrations <app>  # generate migrations after model changes
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser       # bootstrap an admin user
uv run python manage.py test                  # run the full Django test suite
uv run python manage.py test <app>            # run tests for a single app
```

### Local dev setup

Local dev uses **Postgres** (not SQLite) for full parity with Railway prod (exclusion constraints require it). Start Postgres first:

```bash
docker compose up -d              # start Postgres 17 on localhost:5432
```

Then export the three required env vars (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=any-local-secret-value
export DJANGO_DEBUG=True          # optional; defaults to False if unset
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://envbooker:envbooker@localhost:5432/envbooker
```

Run migrations and start the dev server:

```bash
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

### Project-specific tripwires

- **The uv-managed `.venv` has no `pip`**, so `pip-audit` cannot use `PIPAPI_PYTHON_LOCATION`. Audit via:
  `uv export --no-hashes | grep -v '^#' | pip-audit -r /dev/stdin`
- **Railway deploy** is defined in `railway.toml`: Railpack builder (auto-detects `uv.lock` + `.python-version`), runs `collectstatic → migrate → gunicorn` on start. No Dockerfile needed.
- **No linting tools** are configured in `pyproject.toml` yet — add ruff or similar before wiring up CI.

## Course context

This is a **10xDevs 3.0** course project (`10xdevs3`), configured for Claude Code via `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli` (v1.6.0). Lesson artifacts (prompts, skills, rules, configs) are fetched from the course platform and written into `.claude/`.

## Fetching lesson content

```bash
10x list                          # browse available modules and lessons
10x get <ref>                     # fetch a lesson (e.g. m1l1 = Module 1 Lesson 1)
10x get <ref> --tool claude-code  # explicit tool override
10x get <ref> --dry-run           # preview what would be written
10x doctor                        # validate auth and connectivity
```

Artifacts land in `.claude/prompts/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc. The manifest tracking applied lessons is at `.claude/.10x-cli-manifest.json`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
