# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: EnvBooker

Django 6.0.5 web app on **Python 3.14** (see `.python-version`), managed with **uv** (not pip/poetry). Single Django config package at `envbooker/`; no domain apps yet — they'll be added as the PRD ships. SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) for dev; **Railway** is the deploy target (see `railway.toml` and `context/foundation/infrastructure.md`). Product & stack rationale live in `context/foundation/`.

### Common commands

```bash
uv sync                              # install/refresh dependencies from uv.lock
uv add <pkg>                         # add a runtime dependency
uv run python manage.py runserver    # dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run python manage.py migrate      # apply pending migrations
uv run python manage.py makemigrations <app>  # generate migrations after model changes
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser       # bootstrap an admin user
uv run python manage.py test                  # run the full Django test suite
uv run python manage.py test <app>            # run tests for a single app
```

### Local dev setup

Local dev uses **Postgres** (not SQLite) for full parity with Railway prod (exclusion constraints require it). Start Postgres first:

```bash
docker compose up -d              # start Postgres 17 on localhost:5432
```

Then export the three required env vars (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=any-local-secret-value
export DJANGO_DEBUG=True          # optional; defaults to False if unset
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://envbooker:envbooker@localhost:5432/envbooker
```

Run migrations and start the dev server:

```bash
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

### Project-specific tripwires

- **The uv-managed `.venv` has no `pip`**, so `pip-audit` cannot use `PIPAPI_PYTHON_LOCATION`. Audit via:
  `uv export --no-hashes | grep -v '^#' | pip-audit -r /dev/stdin`
- **Railway deploy** is defined in `railway.toml`: Railpack builder (auto-detects `uv.lock` + `.python-version`), runs `collectstatic → migrate → gunicorn` on start. No Dockerfile needed.
- **No linting tools** are configured in `pyproject.toml` yet — add ruff or similar before wiring up CI.

## Course context

This is a **10xDevs 3.0** course project (`10xdevs3`), configured for Claude Code via `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli` (v1.6.0). Lesson artifacts (prompts, skills, rules, configs) are fetched from the course platform and written into `.claude/`.

## Fetching lesson content

```bash
10x list                          # browse available modules and lessons
10x get <ref>                     # fetch a lesson (e.g. m1l1 = Module 1 Lesson 1)
10x get <ref> --tool claude-code  # explicit tool override
10x get <ref> --dry-run           # preview what would be written
10x doctor                        # validate auth and connectivity
```

Artifacts land in `.claude/prompts/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc. The manifest tracking applied lessons is at `.claude/.10x-cli-manifest.json`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
