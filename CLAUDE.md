# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: EnvBooker

Django 6.0.5 web app on **Python 3.14** (see `.python-version`), managed with **uv** (not pip/poetry). Single Django config package at `envbooker/`; no domain apps yet — they'll be added as the PRD ships. SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) for dev; **Railway** is the deploy target (see `railway.toml` and `context/foundation/infrastructure.md`). Product & stack rationale live in `context/foundation/`.

### Common commands

```bash
uv sync                              # install/refresh dependencies from uv.lock
uv add <pkg>                         # add a runtime dependency
uv run python manage.py runserver    # dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run python manage.py migrate      # apply pending migrations
uv run python manage.py makemigrations <app>  # generate migrations after model changes
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser       # bootstrap an admin user
uv run python manage.py test                  # run the full Django test suite
uv run python manage.py test <app>            # run tests for a single app
```

### Local dev setup

`settings.py` reads `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` from the environment and will crash on startup if it is missing. Before running the dev server:

```bash
export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=any-local-secret-value
export DJANGO_DEBUG=True          # optional; defaults to False if unset
```

### Project-specific tripwires

- **The uv-managed `.venv` has no `pip`**, so `pip-audit` cannot use `PIPAPI_PYTHON_LOCATION`. Audit via:
  `uv export --no-hashes | grep -v '^#' | pip-audit -r /dev/stdin`
- **Railway deploy** is defined in `railway.toml`: Railpack builder (auto-detects `uv.lock` + `.python-version`), runs `collectstatic → migrate → gunicorn` on start. No Dockerfile needed.
- **No linting tools** are configured in `pyproject.toml` yet — add ruff or similar before wiring up CI.

## Course context

This is a **10xDevs 3.0** course project (`10xdevs3`), configured for Claude Code via `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli` (v1.6.0). Lesson artifacts (prompts, skills, rules, configs) are fetched from the course platform and written into `.claude/`.

## Fetching lesson content

```bash
10x list                          # browse available modules and lessons
10x get <ref>                     # fetch a lesson (e.g. m1l1 = Module 1 Lesson 1)
10x get <ref> --tool claude-code  # explicit tool override
10x get <ref> --dry-run           # preview what would be written
10x doctor                        # validate auth and connectivity
```

Artifacts land in `.claude/prompts/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc. The manifest tracking applied lessons is at `.claude/.10x-cli-manifest.json`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
